Revision of the course, fantastic work.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.265
You've covered a lot of complex but important material in these lessons.

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:09.905
First, we did a review of objects,

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.715
how to create, access, and modify them.

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:16.270
Next, we looked at how functions worked at runtime.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.895
We saw scope, closures,

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.130
and Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
Then, we combined all of these together to build our own classes.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.290
We learned about constructor functions,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.175
use the "this" keyword.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.010
We also made use of prototype on inheritance to create and extend objects.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.760
Finally, we took a close look at a few object-oriented design patterns to create,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.595
extend and even add privacy objects.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.100
Your new skills in object-oriented programming

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.269
opened up a whole new set of career opportunities.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.360
So, congratulations. We'll see you next time.
