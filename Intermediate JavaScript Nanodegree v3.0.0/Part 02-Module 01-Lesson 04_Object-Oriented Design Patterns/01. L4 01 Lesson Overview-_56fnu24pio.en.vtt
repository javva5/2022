00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Up to this point, we've seen lots of ways to create objects.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.205
We've written object literals,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.915
we've created functions that return objects,

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:11.850
we've also built constructor functions to instantiate a new object.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.100
In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.115
a few design patterns that we can not only use to create a new object,

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:18.860
but also extend an object,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.030
all without involving its prototype.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.700
We'll first look at mixins, what they are,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.930
and how they can be used to copy properties from one object to another object.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.705
Then, we'll create objects with private properties using two different design patterns,

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:38.170
the module pattern and the superior revealing module pattern. Let's get started.
