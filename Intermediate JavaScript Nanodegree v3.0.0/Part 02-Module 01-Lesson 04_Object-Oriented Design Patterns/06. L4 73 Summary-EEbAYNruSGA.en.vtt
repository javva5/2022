00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
In this lesson, we took close look at

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.880
a few object-oriented design patterns that we can use to both create and extend objects,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.820
all without involving inheritance.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.220
We first looked at mixins to copy properties and

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.025
methods from one object to another object.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.830
Then, we looked at both the module pattern and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.920
the revealing module pattern to create private properties. Great work.
