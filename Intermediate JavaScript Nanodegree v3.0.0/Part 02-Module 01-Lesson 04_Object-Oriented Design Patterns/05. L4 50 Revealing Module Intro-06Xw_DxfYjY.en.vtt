00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
In the previous section, we saw how using a module allows

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.795
us to create objects with private properties and methods.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:11.215
Now, the reveal module pattern is a slight variation to the module pattern.

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:13.215
The underlying philosophy is the same.

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.470
We use it to maintain encapsulation.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.075
But, with the revealing module pattern,

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:21.630
all data and functions are private and only the ones that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.600
developer wants to be public are revealed. Let's check it out.
