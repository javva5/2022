Rather than using an object literal or simple function to create privacy,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.125
we can leverage a larger unit of organization called a module to achieve true privacy.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.955
This has become a common technique and is known as the module pattern.

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:16.920
The module pattern leverages what we already know about scope and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.320
closures to protect variables from external access.
