00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Here we have some code written in a module pattern.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.785
Just a couple things to point out.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:06.670
Note that we're using an iffy,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.670
meaning that we wrap the entire function in

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
parentheses and then we

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.350
immediately invoke that function with the second set of parentheses over here.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.890
Also, note that we're returning an object with a public function and that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.090
the return value of the entire expression is stored in a variable called myModule.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.100
So, again, this is just a normal module pattern.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.245
How would we go about converting all this to the revealing module pattern?

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:35.465
Well, first, what we should do is move the public methods

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:40.540
outside of the returned object. So, let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.465
So, now, what we have is an empty returned object.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.540
Now, again, the main difference between the module pattern and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.735
the revealing module pattern is that while we still maintain encapsulation,

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:55.490
we can actually choose to reveal specific data and functions.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.935
So, when this return object literal over here,

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.340
we can say publicMethod and the value for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.520
this publicMethod property can actually referenced some of the module content.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.925
We'll go ahead and make it referenced the publicMethod function over here.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:13.070
I'm going to hit Enter, and we'll check I what myModule looks like.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.775
Again, as we expect,

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.750
it's just an object with a single property,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.270
publicMethod, which we can invoke.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.945
So, just to recap, the key components of the revealing module pattern is first an iffy,

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.130
which we used over here,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.300
as well as any module content,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.170
meaning, any variables, methods, objects, etc.,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.990
and the key ingredient that brings everything together is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.870
the returned object literal at the very end over here,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.470
with keys that points any data and functions that you want to reveal.
