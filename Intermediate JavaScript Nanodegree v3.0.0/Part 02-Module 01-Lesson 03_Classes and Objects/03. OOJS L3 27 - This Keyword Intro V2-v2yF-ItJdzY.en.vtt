00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.009
Functions, objects, and the "this" keyword are all interconnected in Javascript.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.154
When a function is called,

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.699
a "this" variable is set to a specific object.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:15.179
Now, the value of "this" depends on just how the function was called.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.359
In this section, we'll explore different ways the call functions,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.129
as well as how each of these sets the value of "this" a little bit differently.
