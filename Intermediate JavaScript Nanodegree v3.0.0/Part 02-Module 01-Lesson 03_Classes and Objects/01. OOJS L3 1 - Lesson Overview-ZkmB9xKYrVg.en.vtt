00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.016
As you've learned throughout this course,

00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:04.654
almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.860
Up until now, we've been building one off objects.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.915
These are fine enough, but to build more structured applications,

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.929
we need to learn how to build the classes or categories of objects.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.765
In this lesson we'll create new objects with constructor functions.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.810
We'll also leverage the this keyword to access objects,

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.721
and even learn how to set the value of this ourselves.

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.949
Finally, we'll learn how to base objects on

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.000
other objects with prototypal inheritance and subclassing.
