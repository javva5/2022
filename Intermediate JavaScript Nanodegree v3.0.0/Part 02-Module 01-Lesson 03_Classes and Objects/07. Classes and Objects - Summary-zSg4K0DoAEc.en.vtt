Great job. This section was all about classes and objects.

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:09.350
We started off by building a constructor function to instantiate new objects.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.925
Then, we learned about function setting a value for the "this" keyword

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:17.644
and how "this" can mean something different depending on how the function is invoked.

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:21.984
We also added functionality to objects by adding methods to the object's prototype.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:27.000
And finally, we implemented prototypal inheritance to extend objects.
