00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.705
Let's go ahead and write out the constructor function called SoftwareDeveloper.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:11.984
So just to recap, when SoftwareDeveloper is invoked with the new keyword,

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:15.879
it's going to create a new object that has a favorite language property,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.949
has a value of JavaScript.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.210
Now let's go ahead and call

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.140
the SoftwareDeveloper constructor function with a new keyword, and create a new object.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.670
Let's call it developer.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.700
If we check out what developer looks like,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.551
we can see that it's indeed an object over here with a single property favorite language,

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:38.640
points to a string JavaScript.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.350
And what's really nice is that we can also see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.450
the constructor function SoftwareDeveloper,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.720
referenced over here in Chrome DevTools as well.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.769
Now, instead of calling

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.205
the software developer constructor function to create a new object,

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:51.649
let's write one out manually.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.701
Let's write it out with object literal notation.

00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:58.519
We'll call this one otherDeveloper.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.049
Great, and let's access it just for good measure.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.189
So compared to developer,

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.174
itsSeems like the object looks pretty much the same actually.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:14.844
Again, it's a single property pointing to a JavaScript just like over here.

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.239
But notice that the constructor function that we

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:20.140
created it with isn't listed in Chrome DevTools.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.560
It might look different depending on if you're using let's say Safari DevTools,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.647
or maybe something in Firefox,

00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:29.629
but in Chrome, usually shows the constructor function that created it right over here.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:33.000
Let's open up each of these.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.143
And now check out their proto properties.

00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:39.730
Don't worry too much about what proto is for now.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.939
We'll take a deep dive into it a little bit later.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.129
So you can see that the constructor for

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:50.429
the developer object was actually the software developer constructor function,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.695
but in the case of other developer,

00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:56.689
the constructor property actually points to the object constructor.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.129
So just a quick comparison.

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.034
The prototypes are going to be a little bit different.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.170
We'll take a deeper dive into each of these shortly.
