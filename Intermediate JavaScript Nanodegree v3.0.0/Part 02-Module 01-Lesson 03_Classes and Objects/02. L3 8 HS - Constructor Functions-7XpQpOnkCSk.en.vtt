00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
You don't have to create an object using object literal notation.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.200
You can also write a function that will return an object.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.990
However, one of the main ways that objects are created is with a constructor function.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.265
A constructor function is similar to a function that returns an object,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.815
but there are a few major differences.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:21.040
For one, a constructor functions starts with a capital letter.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.439
A constructor function must always be called with a special new keyword.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.790
And another major difference is that while a regular function must create

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.164
the object it's going to return and modify that object directly,

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.359
the constructor function has its object created automatically.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.109
Then, to add properties or methods of this object,

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.000
you have to use a special "this" keyword.
