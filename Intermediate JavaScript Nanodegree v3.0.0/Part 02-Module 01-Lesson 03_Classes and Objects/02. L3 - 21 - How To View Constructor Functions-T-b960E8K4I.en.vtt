00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
Here, we have a constructor function called Developer,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.759
which we can invoke to set up a new object,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.984
with a single name property. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:15.192
So, we just called the Developer constructor function using the new keyword.

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:17.044
And pass it a string, Veronika,

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.485
which will be the value of the object's name property.

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:24.757
Let's double check to see if this is indeed an object.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.064
And indeed, it is.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:30.170
Now, we can use the instance of method to

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.465
check if it's an instance of the Developer constructor function.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:38.835
Using the instance of operator returns a boolean.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:40.814
So, we can see that it's indeed true.

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:42.359
One thing to keep in mind here is that,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.615
you don't want to put parentheses at the end of the function name over here.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:48.255
We're not invoking the Developer constructor function,

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:50.000
we are just referring to it by name.
