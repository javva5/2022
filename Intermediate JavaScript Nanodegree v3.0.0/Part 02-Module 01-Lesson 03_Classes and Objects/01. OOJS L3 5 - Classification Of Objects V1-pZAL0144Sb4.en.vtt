00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
So, we have this dog in the dog object.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.060
What if we created an object for this flower?

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.189
For properties, it has green leaves and fragrant.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:16.554
For methods, it can have grow or convert light.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:20.425
Now, we have this dog object and a flower object.

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:24.530
They're both objects but fundamentally, they're quite different.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.960
It might be better if we can make a classification for dog objects,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.179
and one for flower objects.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.549
Object-oriented JavaScript is a way to write code that'll automatically classify objects.
