00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
We reached the end of course. Fantastic work.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
We covered a lot of complex but important materials in this lesson.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.404
We first did a review of objects,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:11.459
how to create, access, and modify them.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.725
Then, we looked at how functions work at runtime.

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.304
We looked at scopes, closures,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.899
and Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.349
Then, we combined all of these together to build our own classes.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.950
We learned about constructor functions,

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.230
used the "this" keyword,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.129
and made use of prototypal inheritance to create and extend objects.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.379
Your new skills on

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:34.299
object-oriented programming opens up a whole new set of career opportunities.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.000
So, congratulations. We'll see you next time.
