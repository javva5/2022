00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
When a function is called, a variable,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.650
this, gets set to a certain value.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.245
But depending on how the function was called,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:10.125
what this refers to can be very different.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.449
If constructor function is called with a new operator,

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.869
this is set to the newly created object.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.019
If a method is called on an object,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.820
this is set to that particular object itself.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.198
And if a normal function is simply invoked,

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:28.865
this is set to window or the global object.

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:32.484
Now, there are a few different ways that we can change the value of this ourselves,

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:34.210
but we'll check them out in the next section.
