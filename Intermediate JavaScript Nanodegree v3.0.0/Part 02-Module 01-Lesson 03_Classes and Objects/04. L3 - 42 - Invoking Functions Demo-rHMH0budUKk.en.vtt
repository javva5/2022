00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Here, we have an object called cat as well as a function, sayHello.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.449
All sayHello does is taking a single parameter and prints out a message to the console.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.309
Now, this might look kind of peculiar,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.359
because sayHello actually references the "this" keyword.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.699
If we invoked sayHello as a function,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.814
what would "this" get set to?

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.429
Well, it would get set to window or the global object.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.766
So, if you wanted "this" to refer to cat,

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:31.649
we can do it ourselves manually using the special call or apply methods.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.734
Let's check out how we can do that, starting with call.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:39.564
Call's a method that we can invoke directly onto a function. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:44.849
We can pass in two arguments right now into the call method.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.045
First, it'll be the object that we bind "this" to which will be cat.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:55.820
Next, it's a set of arguments passed into the function that call is being called on,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.020
in this case would be Hello,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.782
and we know that it takes in a single argument. Just message.

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:03.539
Let's go ahead and pass on that message.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.332
Great, let's go ahead and execute this and see what we get.

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:12.640
And there you have it. Nice to see you, Bailey.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.575
We can actually achieve the same results using the apply method,

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.954
but the arguments passed on are a little bit different.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.429
Let's check it out. I'll switch to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.885
the other window right now to give myself a little bit more space here.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:29.195
Just like call, apply is directly invoked onto a function.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.019
The first argument should be the same,

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:37.744
which is just the object that you want to bind this to, in this case would be cat.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:42.680
Next, rather than separating individual arguments that will be passed

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.178
into the sayHello function by commas like we do with call,

00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:51.105
apply actually takes in all the arguments in the form of an array.

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:52.924
Again, we know in this case it's a single argument

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.474
because sayHello only takes in message.

00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:59.427
So let's go ahead and pass on our message in an array.

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:04.078
Great, let's invoke it and see what happens.

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:06.640
Hello, Bailey. There we go.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.289
Call and apply are great ways to set the value of "this" ourselves.
