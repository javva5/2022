We've seen how "this" gets set depending on how a function is called.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.285
But what if we wanted to set the value of "this" ourselves?

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:12.640
Javascript offers a few methods that allow you to do just that.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.594
These methods are: call, apply, and bind.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:19.769
Call and apply are called as methods on

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.155
a function with a few slight differences in how arguments are passed into them.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.815
On the other hand, bind is a method that returns a new function.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.000
Each of these methods are used in different contexts. Let's check them out.
