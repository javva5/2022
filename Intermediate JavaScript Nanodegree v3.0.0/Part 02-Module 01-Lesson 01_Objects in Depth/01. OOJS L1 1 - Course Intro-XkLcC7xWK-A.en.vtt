00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
JavaScript is a powerful and articulate language.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.750
Whether you're working with the browsers DOM API,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.254
or building elements with popular libraries like React or Angular,

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.250
the JavaScript language helps you to create dynamic experiences for the web.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.590
Now, up until this point,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.905
you've probably been writing your codes so that it runs linearly.

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:19.459
Code at the top of the file runs first,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.755
then the next line of code, then the next,

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.629
all the way down to the bottom of the file.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.599
Through this course, you'll take your JavaScript skills to another level of

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.945
sophistication called object-oriented programming.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:33.649
Using objec-oriented programming, you'll be able to write classes capable of

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.714
creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.490
You also discover how delegation and inheritance can be used

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.120
to build well-architected in performance applications.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.109
First, we'll take a deep dive into object fundamentals.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.094
JavaScript has a pretty distinct take on classical object-oriented programming.

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:55.579
So make sure you start with a solid foundation of how objects work in JavaScript.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.750
Then we'll take a look at how functions are first class functions.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.344
After that, we'll jump to classes, what they are,

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:05.049
and how they can be used to create objects.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.109
So, Hi. I'm Richard.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:07.310
And I'm Andrew.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.060
Welcome to this course on object-oriented JavaScript. We're glad you're here.
