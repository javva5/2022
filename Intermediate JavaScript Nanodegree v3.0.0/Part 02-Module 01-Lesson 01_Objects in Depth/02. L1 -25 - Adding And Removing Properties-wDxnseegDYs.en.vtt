00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Here, we have the cat object from earlier,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.235
and you can see how it has four properties: age,

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.720
name, meow, and greet, which point to a function.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.410
Now, let's go ahead and add two more properties.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.650
Let's just say that this cat has a color property.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.240
I mean, give it a value of gray.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:27.199
And we can also say that this cat has a sayName property and we give this one a function.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.780
Let's go ahead and see what the new cat object looks like.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.545
I'm going to clear my console.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.179
Okay. Now, we can see that in

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.179
addition to the four original properties that we had in the cat object,

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.354
it now has a color property, gray,

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.744
and the sayName property,

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:49.669
which points to a function.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.510
Now, let's change up this cat property just a little bit.

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:57.754
Let's go ahead and delete the greet property from the cat because,

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.136
of course, cats can't talk.

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:05.635
Now, if we try to invoke the greet method on this cat object,

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:08.665
we get a type error.

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.510
Cat.greet is not a function.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.440
Let's kind of see what's going on. If we access the property on its own,

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.239
we can see that it's undefined.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.351
It actually doesn't exist in this object anymore.

00:01:18.352 --> 00:01:21.237
So, that's why you get a type error when we're trying to invoke the greet method.

00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:24.194
Let's check out the cat object.

00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:27.284
So, running out of space down here,

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:29.314
let's go ahead and collapse the original one

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.399
and take a look at what's going on inside the new cat object.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520
You see that it has now five properties: age,

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.009
color, meow, name, and sayName.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.000
Notice how the greet property is now gone because we deleted it.
