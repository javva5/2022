00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.304
Here, we have an object cat that has two properties: age,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.044
which points to a number two,

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:10.019
and name which points to a string of Bailey.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.013
Now let's go ahead and add another property.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.579
Let's go ahead and call it, meow,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.295
and have this point to a function.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.080
You can see that all this function does is just

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.174
print the string meow to the console, just click console.log.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:31.750
So, just like how cat.age allows us to access the property age,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.170
gives you a value of two,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.179
you can check out the value of meow property on cat,

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.269
and see that it is indeed a function.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.920
So now, to call this function,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.105
to invoke this function,

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.844
patch the meow property,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.259
all we have to do is just attach parentheses at the end of it,

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:49.695
just as if it's any other function that we're invoking.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:54.530
So, cat.meow logs meow as a string to the console.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.899
Excellent. Let's refresh the console.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.269
Now, let's go ahead and add another property to this cat object.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.379
We added a new greet property to the cat object,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.439
which points to another function, but this time,

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.899
the function takes in a single argument, a person.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.395
So, what this function does is just print out hello,

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:26.829
person's name, exclamation mark right to the console. Let's check it out.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.159
Cat.greet. Now, within the parenthesis, let's pass it as string.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.694
We'll just say my name, Andrew.

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:40.579
Excellent. So, invoking greet on this cat object,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.105
while passing in a single argument,

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:46.000
Andrew, logs out "Hello Andrew!" And there you have it.
