Great job. We started off this lesson by

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.330
looking at how we can access properties in an object.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.125
We then went on to create and modify objects.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.370
Finally, we closed out the lesson with some useful object methods.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.500
For more foundation or reading on objects,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.230
definitely check out the links listed below.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.144
Next, we'll learn why JavaScript functions are actually objects.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:22.660
You might be surprised to discover,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.000
that you've been using these function objects all along.
