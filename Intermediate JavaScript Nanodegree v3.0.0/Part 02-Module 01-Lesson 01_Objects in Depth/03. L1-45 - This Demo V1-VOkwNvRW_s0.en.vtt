00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.314
Here, we have the dog object with a couple properties on it.

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:05.745
Three of which are actually methods.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.460
Let's check out each of these methods and see how each of them can

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.105
access the dog object using the special "this" keyword.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.859
Let's start off the very top, "whatIsThis".

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.320
If we called "whatIsThis" on dog,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.140
all it's going to do is print out the value of "this" to the console.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.969
So let's see what this looks like.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.549
Pretty interesting. So it looks like we have

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.274
an object with a couple of properties on it: name,

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.664
age, "whatIsThis", woof, and "ageOneYear".

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.850
It's actually the same set of properties as the properties in dog

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.329
because "this" refers to the dog object itself.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.179
That's pretty straightforward. Check out the next one.

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.219
If we call the "woof" on dog,

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.364
what we get printed to the console is the message, "Jodi says 'woof!'"

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.914
So, let's kind of explore how it does that.

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.464
So when woof, what's your console logging is

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.330
this.name concatenated with a string says "woof".

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.960
So, we know for the example that "this",

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.945
just refers to the dog object.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.364
So, this is dog,

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.875
accessing the name property gets us the string "Jodi".

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:11.909
So if you add that together this.name which is Jodi plus "says 'woof!'",

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.118
you get "Jodi says 'woof!'".

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:17.010
Great. So we'll check out the next one, "ageOneYear".

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.540
Let's go ahead and call this one on dog.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.034
It looks like what we get is current age: 8.

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:28.364
So how does it do that?

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:31.164
Let's take a look a little more closely at the "ageOneYear" method.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:37.405
So, we see that it accesses the this.age property and increments that by a value of 1.

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:40.090
Well, again we know "this" refers to a dog.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.895
So if we grab the age property of dog,

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.924
we can see that it's a value of 7.

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:47.134
And then 7 incremented by 1,

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:49.090
is going to give you 8.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.640
And after that, all the method does is

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.724
that it's going to print the console the string "Current

00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:58.944
age" and concatenate that with this.age which is now going to be 8.

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:03.914
So, "ageOneYear" can not only access the age property of the dog object,

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:08.645
it can also directly mutate it by incrementing it by a value of 1.

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:11.094
So everything you just saw here was possible using

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:16.819
the "this" keyword which gives methods access to the object on which it was called.
