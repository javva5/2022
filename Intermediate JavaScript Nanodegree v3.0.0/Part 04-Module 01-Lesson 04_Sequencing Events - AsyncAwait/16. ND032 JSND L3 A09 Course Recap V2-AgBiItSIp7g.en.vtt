00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Just like that, we're at the end of the course.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.830
Thank you so much for sticking with me through all the new concepts and syntax.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.285
I hope that this course has dissolved any mystery surrounding asynchronous programming,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:16.350
and that you feel equipped to use these skills in your job or next project.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.540
In this course, you've achieved a ton,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.930
and taken a huge step forward in your skills as a developer.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.570
Like I mentioned at the very beginning of the course,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.675
mastering asynchronous programming is a vital skill,

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:29.949
especially for JavaScript developers,

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.890
and it doesn't happen overnight.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.660
Beyond this course, I encourage you to practice these concepts and look

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.335
for how other developers are using them in their libraries and codebases,

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:42.530
so that you can truly master asynchronous programming.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.200
All the best to you, and good luck in the project.
