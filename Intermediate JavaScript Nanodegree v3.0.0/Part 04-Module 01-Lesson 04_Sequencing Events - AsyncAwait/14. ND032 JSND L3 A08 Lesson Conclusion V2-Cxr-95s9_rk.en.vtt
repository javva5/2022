00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Congratulations.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.360
You made it through Async/Await.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.565
Let's take a look back at what we did.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.265
We went back and looked at some synchronous code,

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.570
and learned to use Try/Catch blocks for exception handling in our programs.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.060
We learned the Async/Await syntax,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.375
and the implementation of Async/Await with promise chains.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.470
Then we combined our knowledge of Try/Catch and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.680
Async/Await to get some practice with exception handling in Async/Await.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
We wrapped up with some discussion of when it's a good idea to use Async/Await,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.175
and when it might not be.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:34.320
All in all, we covered a lot and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.455
these concepts aren't necessarily easy or straightforward,

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.600
but I hope you've gained some confidence to start

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.090
trying them out and practicing in your own programs.
