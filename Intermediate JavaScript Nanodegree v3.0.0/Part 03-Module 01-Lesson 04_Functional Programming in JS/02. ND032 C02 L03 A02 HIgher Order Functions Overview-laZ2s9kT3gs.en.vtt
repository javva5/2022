00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
We now know that map,

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:06.569
filter and reduce are higher-order functions because they take a callback.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.175
But let's take a closer look at the details.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.450
You'll recognize this example from a previous lesson,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.050
but just to look in more detail at how doubler is

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.220
the callback and map is the higher-order function.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.085
For every item in the nums array,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.700
map will call back to the doubler function.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.374
When it calls it, it actually supplies

00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:33.290
three arguments: the value of the item in the array,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.020
the index of the current item in the array,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.460
and the entire original array that we are mapping over.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.929
Now, because doubler only takes in one argument,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.790
the other two are left off.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.610
But one thing to be aware of is that if the function you're

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.955
calling in map does take more than one argument,

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:58.475
these values will be passed in for the array that you're running it on.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.365
Now that you've seen that in action,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.880
you can try it in the exercises.
