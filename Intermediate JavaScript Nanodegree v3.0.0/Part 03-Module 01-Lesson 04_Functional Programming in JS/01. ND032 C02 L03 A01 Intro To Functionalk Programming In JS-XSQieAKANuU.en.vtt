00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
In the last lesson, we went over

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.085
all the tools that equip us to write a functional JavaScript,

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:07.530
but we didn't write any real programs.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.970
This lesson will be all about using the tools we learned together to create

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.220
powerful functional programs that benefit from

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.980
the strengths of functional programming we learned in the first lesson.
