00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Whether it's from a database,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.915
API or any other source,

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:08.595
manipulating and consuming data is something that every developer needs to be able to do.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.520
Getting exactly the information you want out of

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.790
a large or complex set of data can be frustrating.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.610
We'll cover how the tools and rules we've

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.790
learned so far can help us navigate these data structures.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.420
Here are some quick tips when working with large data sets.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.045
The first tip for working with large data sets

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.925
is to determine the points and shape that you need.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.280
When we talk about data shape, we're talking about,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.480
is it an object inside of an array or an array inside of an object.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.270
Being able to give your program exactly the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.560
shape that fits it best will make your life a lot easier.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.435
The second tip is to locate one individual item to use as an example.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:51.805
Oftentimes, an API will send you back a long array of objects,

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:54.025
and those objects can be complicated.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:57.835
Just pull one out and find the values that you need.

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:02.740
Another tip is that sometimes working up the data tree is easier than down.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.570
We want to deal with API responses like we do text and read it from the top down,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.170
but it's often easier to start with a specific object or value we

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.375
want to get and find the path to it as we work our way up the data.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:20.055
The last tip is to extract the information you need as soon as you can.

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:24.560
You probably aren't going to use 100 percent of an API response in your app,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.260
so grab out the information you need in the same function that handles the response.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.690
Most of the time,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.970
data manipulation skills will help you work with data coming from outside your app,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.655
for example, from an API.

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:38.120
Later on in the lesson,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.090
we will cover how we can work with the DOM in a functional way,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.755
and this will be the foundation for building functional apps in JavaScript.

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:46.415
In the next exercise,

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:49.355
you'll get to work with some real API response data.

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:52.170
Maybe these tips will come in handy.
