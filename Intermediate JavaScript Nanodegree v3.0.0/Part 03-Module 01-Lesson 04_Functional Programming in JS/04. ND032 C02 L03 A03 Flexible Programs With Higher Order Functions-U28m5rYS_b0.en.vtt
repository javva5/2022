00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
The real power of higher-order functions comes

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.970
when you use this pattern to extend functionality.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.610
You might have noticed in the last exercise that

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.419
the higher-order functions can quickly accumulate a lot of arguments,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.830
because they need to take arguments for both themselves and the callbacks they invoke.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.975
When you see this starting to be an issue,

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.470
it might help to use the second ability of higher-order functions,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.810
which is the ability to return a function.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.785
This way we can create a closure around an inner function,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.345
but that can be confusing.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.250
So let's take a look at an example.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.360
In this example, I have a function called greater than,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.175
which returns a function.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:42.394
If I call the greater than function and store its result in a variable,

00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:46.970
I can console log that variable and see that it stores a function.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.755
But if I call that variable and pass a value to it,

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:55.400
I get true that 11 is in fact greater than eight.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.610
We have nested our functions together in a way

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.060
that allows us to pass arguments to them one at a time.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.815
If this syntax is a little bit confusing for you though,

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:10.325
know that this and this are exactly the same.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:16.705
Function greater than returns another function which returns a value.

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:20.510
This relies on a pre firm understanding of closures.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.040
So if you need a refresher on that,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.170
we have some resources linked for you.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.495
That syntax was a little bit tricky,

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:30.990
but you'll get the chance to be more familiar with it in the exercises.
