00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
You've made it to the next lesson in the functional programming course.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:04.800
In the previous lesson,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.400
we talked about the ideals and general principles of functional programming,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.015
but did you notice how JavaScript wasn't talked about?

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.420
That's because it's not really a functional language.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.590
But we can still write good functional style JavaScript.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.785
From here on out, I'm going to make a distinction between functional programming,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.980
the pure academic lambda calculus rules,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
and the functional style where we take queues from functional programming and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.755
apply them practically in languages not traditionally recognized as functional.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.590
In this lesson, we'll cover the tools and syntax

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.320
we have within JavaScript to write functional programs.
