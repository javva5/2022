00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
It can be confusing to know when to use each of the ES6 array methods,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.380
but what I've found is that it's easiest to

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.200
pay attention to the end result that you want.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.425
For instance, map takes in an array and returns a new array of the same length,

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:21.615
but it performs the same action on each item.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.325
Filter, on the other hand,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:27.585
takes in an array but returns a subset of that array.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.190
It doesn't change the individual values,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.740
but what it does is filter out some of the items and leave the rest.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.505
Reduce takes in an array,

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.324
but it returns a single value.

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:44.210
It finds a familiar property on each item,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.310
and then returns the sum or the aggregate of that.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.260
So if you're ever aren't sure which to use,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.290
first determine what you want back, and that'll be a big help.
