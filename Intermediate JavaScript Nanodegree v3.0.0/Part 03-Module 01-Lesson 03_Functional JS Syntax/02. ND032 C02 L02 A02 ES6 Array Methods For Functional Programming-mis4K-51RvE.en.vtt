00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Working with arrays is an essential programming skill,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.185
and JavaScript gives us lots of tools to work with arrays in a functional way,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.620
but it might not be all the ways you're used to.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.945
For instance, you've probably used push,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.835
or shift, or pop to manipulate arrays.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.105
But each of these change the array they are run on,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.995
so they're called mutators.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.960
Editing values like this, of course,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.985
goes against the functional rule of,

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.190
you guessed it, immutability.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.165
In this lesson, we're going to cover the functional array methods.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.730
We'll be focusing on the ones here,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.800
map, filter, and reduce.
