00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
The variables we use are also important to functional programming.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.835
While learning JavaScript, you've likely seen a confusing mess of var, let, and const.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.300
Just to be sure that we're all on the same page,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.120
let's take a quick look at each of them.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.630
Var is the older pre ES6 variable that works in pre ES6 environments.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.060
It comes with some of its own domains that lead

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.955
JavaScript to develop two new variable types.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.390
The issues with var are outside the scope of this course to talk about,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.950
but if you're interested in learning more,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.965
there will be resources at the end of the lesson just for that.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:36.770
Let and const were added in an effort to clean up some of the issues with var.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.820
It's now recommended to use either of them in your code instead of var.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.510
There's some dispute over which one you should use in a general program,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600
but for functional style JavaScript,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.095
the only correct answer is to use const.

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:54.950
Consts are immutable, meaning that once a value is declared as a const,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.340
its value cannot be edited, at least mostly.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.860
We'll get to that. But in general,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.800
const will be the best fit with a functional program.
