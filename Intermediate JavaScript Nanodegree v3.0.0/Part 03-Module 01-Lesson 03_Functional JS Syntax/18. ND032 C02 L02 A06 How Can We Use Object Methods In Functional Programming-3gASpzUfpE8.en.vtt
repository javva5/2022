00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Object freeze is one way to deal with the shortcomings of const,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.465
to ensure that objects cannot be changed.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.420
This is the Mozilla definition of object freeze:

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.610
"A frozen object can no longer be changed.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.675
A frozen object can have no properties added to it,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.225
removed from it, or its values edited.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.935
It effectively makes an immutable object."

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:24.620
In this example, I have an object declared as a const.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.810
But even though this is a const,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.930
I can actually update values in

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.675
the object as long as I don't replace the object, const'll let me do it.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:38.680
So if I run this code,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.265
you'll see that I can indeed update the current season.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:49.045
But if I freeze the object and run it again,

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:56.100
we get an error, because you cannot update any value on a frozen object.
