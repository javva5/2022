00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
This lesson was all about getting more comfortable with ES6 syntax,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.670
especially in the methods we might use in our functional style JavaScript programs.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.320
The more methods you learn,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.975
the better equipped you are to use the right one for the job

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.650
instead of writing more code to make the method you know work.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.570
Not only will learning more of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.110
the available methods make you a more efficient JavaScript developer,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.945
but these methods, especially the ES6 ones,

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:28.780
will make an appearance in almost every JavaScript interview.
