00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
Here, we have a function expression.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.269
It's an anonymous function assigned to a variable called

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.969
"returnsAFunction" and the return value of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.250
this function is actually, well, another function.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.044
It's a function that just outputs "Hello from inside a function!"

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:17.759
to the console. Let's go ahead and assign

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.755
the return value of returnsAFunction to a new variable.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:25.739
Let's call it "newFunction".

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.009
So as you can see here,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.205
we're invoking the "returnsAFunction" function

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.859
and assigning that return value to a variable, "newFunction".

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.399
So now if we invoke it,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.894
we should see the message "Hello from inside a function!"

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:43.380
print to the console. And indeed we do.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.900
One thing we also could have done was just immediately execute the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.973
"returnsAFunction" as well just by adding parenthesis.

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:52.754
So if we type "returnsAFunction",

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:57.798
call it, and then invoke that return function,

00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:02.064
we should see the same message printed out to the console.

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:05.019
Great. Hello to you, too.
