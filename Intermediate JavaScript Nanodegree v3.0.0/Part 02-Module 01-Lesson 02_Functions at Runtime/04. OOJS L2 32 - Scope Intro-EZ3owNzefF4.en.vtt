00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.645
When you write a function,

00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:04.290
it has access to its own arguments.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.644
Functions are able to use any arguments passed directly into them,

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:09.304
such as numbers, strings,

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:11.279
or even other functions.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.875
Second, functions are able to access

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.740
any local variables declared inside the function itself.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:23.399
Third, a function has access to the same variables its parent function uses.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.409
This includes the parent functions' local variables,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.539
the parent functions' arguments,

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.649
or even the variables in the parent functions' parent function scope.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.814
And lastly, functions can use global variables,

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:39.159
meaning, any variables defined outside of all functions.
