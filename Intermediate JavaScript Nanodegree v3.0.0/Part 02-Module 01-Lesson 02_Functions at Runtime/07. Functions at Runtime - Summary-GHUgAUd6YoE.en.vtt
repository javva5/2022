00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.615
In this lesson, you'll learn about using functions as values,

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:09.025
and we can do this because Javascript has FirstClass functions.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.875
We also passed functions as arguments,

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.349
identified when a scope is created and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.155
leveraged closure to capture variables within a scope chain.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.140
Finally, we connected immediately invoked

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.359
function expressions with scoping closure to create privacy in data.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.314
In the next lesson, we'll check out how to build classes

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:31.000
that can serve as blueprints for creating new objects.
