00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
In JavaScript, functions are first-class functions.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.215
But what does that mean?

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.849
First, think of a string.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.369
Let's use the string, Udacity.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.945
This string can be stored in a variable.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.759
It can be returned from a function.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.864
And it can be passed as an argument to a function.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:20.534
However, not all programming languages have

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.350
equal support for the different data structures.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.493
For example, in some languages,

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:27.780
functions can't be stored in variables.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.660
They can't be passed as arguments to other functions.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
And they can't be the return value of a function.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.759
So compared with the humble string,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:38.799
the function doesn't have all of these privileges.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.358
Now, that's for some languages.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.359
JavaScript does have first-class functions.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.130
This means that the JavaScript function can do

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.410
all of the things we did with the Udacity string.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.049
We can store it in a variable.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.164
We can pass it as an argument.

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.460
And we can return it from a function.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.250
So a first-class function means it has equal status in that programming language,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.000
as the other data structures.
