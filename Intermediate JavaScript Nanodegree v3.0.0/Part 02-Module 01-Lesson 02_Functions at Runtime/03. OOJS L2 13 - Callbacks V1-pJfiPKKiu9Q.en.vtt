00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
You've written functions in JavaScript that can

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:05.160
be called with different types of arguments.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.189
Sometimes, you might pass in a string to the function.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.039
Sometimes, you might pass in a number.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.339
And maybe other times,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.000
you might pass in a combination of different arguments.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.509
Now, because Javascript functions are FirstClass functions,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.570
we can also pass functions as arguments into other functions.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.140
A function passed into another function as an argument is called a callback function.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
And the receiving function can execute the callback function after running its own code.
