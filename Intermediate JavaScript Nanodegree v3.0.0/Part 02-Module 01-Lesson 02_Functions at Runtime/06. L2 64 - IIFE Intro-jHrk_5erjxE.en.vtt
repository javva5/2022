00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
A function that is called immediately after it's

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.389
defined is known as an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.814
commonly abbreviated to I I F E, pronounced IIFE.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:12.205
Let's check out an example.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:16.815
Here, we have a function declaration for a function named logger.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.804
We can easily turn it into a function expression by wrapping it in parentheses.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:25.125
Keep in mind that a function expression can also be anonymous.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.838
If we append parentheses to the end of this function expression,

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:32.000
the function will be called right after it's defined.
