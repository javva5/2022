00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Here's a quote from earlier. Just to recap,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:06.945
we grabbed the button from the page and store that in a variable that we call, button.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.637
Then on button, we AddEventListner for click and we pass it in f field.

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:17.120
Note that the if field returns a function that closes over the count variable.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.789
What we also have is the page itself.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.720
All it is is just a simple button,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:26.229
and the script tag just references the button that JS file that we just saw.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.625
Now, we'll see it all in action.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.225
So if I click once,

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:33.405
click it again, we see the alert.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's try it again.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.000
Excellent.
