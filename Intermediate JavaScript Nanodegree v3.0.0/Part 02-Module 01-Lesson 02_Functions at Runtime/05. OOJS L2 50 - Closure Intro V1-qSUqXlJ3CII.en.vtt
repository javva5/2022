00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Closure. It's kind of a weird word that's not super descriptive.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:06.529
So, what is it?

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.339
A closure is a combination of a function and it's lexical environment,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.140
which is the scope of the function,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.005
which is basically what identifiers that has access to.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.179
Scope and closure, they're very closely related.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.804
Now, every function has its own closure just like every function has its own scope.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.850
What makes the function's closure powerful is

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.234
when that function is returned from another function.

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:32.880
When a function is declared in a function but

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
returned and run outside of where it was declared,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.010
it will still have access to the scope it was declared in because of closure.
