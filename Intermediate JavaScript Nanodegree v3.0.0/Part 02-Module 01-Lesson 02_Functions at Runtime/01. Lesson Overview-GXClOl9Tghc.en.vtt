00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
What's this code? If you said object, you'd be right.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.070
Wait, what object? That's right.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.380
You've probably learned that this is a "function. "

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.050
Yeah, that could be true.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.644
So, is it a function or is it an object?

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:19.804
That's for me to know and you to find out.

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:24.489
In this lesson, you'll learn about this mysterious thing and discover if it's an object,

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.000
a function, or a function object.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.460
In the process, you'll learn to write cleaner,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.859
more efficient code and also understand how

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.070
powerful Javascript can be in the applications you build.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.579
You'll learn how to pass functions as arguments to other functions,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.445
how to identify when and how scope is created.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.789
You'll also learn how functions can keep track of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.939
the variables around them through a concept called closure.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:50.609
And finally, you'll use functions that are immediately

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.000
invoked after they're declared to manage private data.
