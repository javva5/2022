00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
Let's take a look at the project starter code.

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:07.200
In this video, I'm going to show you how to start the app and set up the API,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
and then we'll take a tour of the repo and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.720
its structure and show you where you'll be writing your code.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.270
At the end, we'll take a look at the ways that you

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.895
can improve the project and make it your own.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:21.600
For this project, the API is written to be a black box.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.035
You don't need to edit anything in it.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:28.835
We compile the API into a binary and it will run on a separate terminal tab,

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:30.440
just like a Node server.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.830
To start it, we need to run this command.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.080
Simply select your operating system from

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.650
the list and then run the command associated with it.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.590
When you do that, you should be able to see that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.890
the program is running and that terminal tab is taking over.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.330
Then in another tab,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.210
you can start the front-end by running npm start.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.525
Once you have both the API and the front-end running,

00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:00.145
you should be able to see the page on localhost: 3000.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:04.415
Here you can see that we have some base HTML setup for you.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.355
If you click the "Start My Race" button,

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.335
you'll come to the first page.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:13.850
But the options to create a race are not available yet,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.150
and that's because your first task will be to make

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.125
the API request to add these options to the front-end.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.780
So let's take a look at where your code will go and the structure of this repo.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.015
First, you'll see that we have a server folder

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.840
which has the index.js file that will run the front-end.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.625
You don't have to do anything here,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.590
but it might be nice to know where it is.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.135
In the client folder,

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:43.145
you'll see that we already have some style sheets and JavaScript files created for you,

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.535
as well as some base HTML pages.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.230
In the JavaScript folder,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.305
we have the main file where you will be doing your work.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:54.695
This file already has a lot of code written for you.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:59.480
Any code marked does provided should not be removed or edited,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.050
everything will work if this stays the same.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.770
But your tasks are marked with TODOs,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.735
they have a comment explaining what you should do at each stage.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:13.940
Your main task in this project will be to fill out these TODOs with your own code.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.575
As you do that, you should be able to play through more and more of the game.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.050
As some advice for getting started,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.050
I would suggest starting by reading through

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.325
this entire file to see how much you can understand.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:30.365
Second, it's probably helpful to build

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.770
each step as you need it by playing through the game.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.465
Here you can see that I don't have the options to select a race or a racer.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.480
So it would be a good idea to start with

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.900
the API requests that will let me see those options.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.640
All of the API requests take place here at the bottom.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.055
Now let's talk about how you can make this project your own.

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:55.040
When I created my example for this project,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.225
I decided to theme it as Star Wars.

00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:01.220
But you can theme it as whatever you want.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.950
Here you can see that all of my options,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.355
racers, and CSS are styled to a theme.

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:10.255
You can do the same with anything that you'd like.

00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:14.330
Hopefully, you'll find this project to be both fun and challenging as it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.140
forces you to use all of the asynchronous concepts we've learned in this course.
