00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
Congratulations. You're done with the lesson,

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:04.575
and this was a really heavy lesson.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:07.365
You got a primer on programming paradigms,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.290
learned the foundational concepts of the functional paradigm,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.275
as well as some of the reasons developers are choosing it today.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.750
But you can breath a small sigh of relief because from here on out, it's mostly code.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.450
Get ready for all the challenges headed your way in the JavaScript syntax lesson.
