  <h3><p>relationship between programming languages and paradigms</p></h3>
  <div>
  <h2 id="relationship-between-programming-languages--paradigms">Relationship Between Programming Languages &amp; Paradigms</h2>
<p>We sometimes describe a <strong>programming language</strong> by its <em>paradigm</em> like “<strong>Haskell</strong> is a <em>Functional</em> programming language,” and that is true, but this is a course on writing Functional JavaScript. </p>
<p>If JavaScript is a functional language, why would we have to learn to write it functionally? The reality is that all of the most popular dynamic programming languages in use today have the features necessary to create programs that follow the style of whichever paradigm we choose. <strong>Some programming languages are written to write programs in one paradigm, other languages can write programs in whatever paradigm the author chooses</strong>. </p>
<p>JavaScript, more than most other programming languages, can be used to write in the paradigm and style of the authors’ choosing. It is a shape-shifting language, which can be both a wonderful freedom and source of chaos for JavaScript developers. Perhaps you have already seen some chaotic JavaScript programs ( if not, you will ) and it is often due at least in part to having so much freedom in the language. Later in this course, we will walk through one program in multiple paradigms so that you get a taste for concrete differences between these paradigms.</p>

  <h3><p>Paradigms reading</p></h3>
  <div>
  <h3 id="how-do-you-choose-a-programming-paradigm-br">How do you choose a programming paradigm? <br></h3>
<p>This can be a daunting question. When you start thinking about a new project, without a single line of code even written yet, how can you have confidence you’re choosing the right paradigm for the job? </p>
<p>Here are some things to consider. If your application is inherently state-based, like maybe a simple game, a blog, or a GUI, it is likely a good candidate for Object Oriented programming, because the entities in an Object Oriented program are easier to reason about. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a large program that needs to have a high degree of reliability, or if you need to manage lots of user interactions and fast updates, then it might be a good sign that you could write a Functional program. Functional programs shine especially when you need to leverage concurrency. As chips have become about as fast as we can make them, the way to get faster computers has been to add more cores. But those cores are useless to make our programs faster unless we can use them well. For a program that manages concurrency well, you probably would want to rethink your decision to use JavaScript, but the Functional Paradigm would be the best choice. </p>
<p>It turns out though, that the choice of programming paradigm is quite personal and subjective among developers. Many people will learn a paradigm and more or less stick to it. For instance, a person who is comfortable with Object Oriented programs will trend towards creating more Object Oriented programs, because at the end of the day, we want to build things more than we want to think about building things. </p>
<p>Another way to go about it is to know the strengths and weaknesses of the various paradigms and try to choose one based on which is the best fit for the thing you are trying to build. This might mean you choose a paradigm you are less familiar with, meaning that development of your project will take longer initially. </p>
<p>Neither of these approaches is bad, and you will find what works for you. I lean towards the second option and it's my personal opinion that over time trying to choose the best paradigm for the problem will make you a more well rounded developer. The only time I go away from that is prototyping. When you just need to get a rough idea of an app working, use the paradigm you are most familiar with as this will help you move quickly and with confidence before motivation for the project fizzles out. Once the idea has proven itself a little bit, and you have good visibility into the tricky parts of your particular program, you can re-evaluate which paradigm would be best. Of course, this requires re-writing your program at some point. </p>

  <h2 id="paradigm-summary">Paradigm Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you are beginning to get a clearer picture of what a paradigm is and the range of them that exist, and perhaps I have also convinced you that learning them will benefit your career. But you can relax because we are going to put away the theory for a little while now and in the next section dive into some code examples to compare paradigms.<br><br>If you want some extra thoughts to chew on, the article's in the <strong>Further Research</strong> section below is full of good ideas about paradigms and coding in general. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend the article, An Introduction to Programming Paradigms, from Digital Fellows by Patrick Smyth, especially the sections following sections:</p>
