00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Welcome to the introduction of functional programming.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.865
Let's dial it back for a second though,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.030
and before taking a look at functional programming in particular,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.225
take a look at programming paradigms in general.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.595
What is a programming paradigm?

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.645
A paradigm is an overarching approach or style to problem-solving.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:22.965
Sometimes I think of it as the worldview or culture of a programming language.

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:26.475
One definition states, a programming paradigm

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.285
is a philosophy style or general approach to writing code.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.135
But what are some of these programming paradigms?

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:37.525
Here are a few you might run across in real life and that we will cover in this lesson.

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:39.840
The first is the imperative style.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.195
Much like in grammar,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.960
imperatives tell the program what to do step-by-step.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
Imperative programs tend to be the first ones we write when we're learning to code.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.795
Because they're very intuitive and oftenly read like recipes,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.690
they're very easy to reason about.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.540
The next is functional.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.000
As you might have guessed,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.140
the functional paradigm is concerned with functions,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.000
where imperative programs describe each action more or less than order.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.165
A functional program would put all of those actions into a function,

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:15.325
and then those functions can be called anywhere or even chained together.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.620
Another paradigm is the object-oriented paradigm.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.610
It is by far the most commonly used in web development today.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.854
Instead of describing steps to be followed or putting functionality into functions,

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:34.820
object-oriented programs focus on objects or the entities in our application.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.630
By putting state and functionality inside of these objects,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.275
we can get a very intuitive program.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.000
There are many more programming paradigms out there,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510
but these three are probably the most popular.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.585
In the next section,

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:52.260
you'll get to see a full list of paradigms and read about one or two in detail.
