00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
A side effect is any effect of running

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.745
a function that is not part of the return statement.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.770
You'll see what I mean in this example.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.210
In this program, I have an object called galaxy_ship and

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.250
a function called stock_arsenal that will update my torpedo_balance.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.100
When I call stock_arsenal,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.900
I can call the number of torpedoes that I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.650
want and the ID of the ship I want to run it on.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.505
Which all of this looks fantastic except for this line right here.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:32.005
You can see that I'm actually updating galaxy_ship in the middle of my function.

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:33.780
This is a side effect.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.850
The side effect is causing my function to change

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.030
my program without encapsulating that change in the return value.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.475
Side effects might seem harmless in a small program,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:47.960
but as the program grows,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.460
it can create problems.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.505
Pure functions must be without side effects,

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:56.550
which makes our programs more reliable and edge case free.
