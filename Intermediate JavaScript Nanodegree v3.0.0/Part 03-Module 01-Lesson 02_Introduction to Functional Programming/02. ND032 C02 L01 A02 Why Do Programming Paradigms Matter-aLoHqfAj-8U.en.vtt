00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
You might think that you've gotten an awful long ways in

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.034
your coding career without feeling the need to learn about programming paradigms.

00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:08.730
Why start now?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.100
It's certainly a more theoretical side to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.190
programming that might seem stuffy or difficult to apply.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.640
But I'm going to say that every programmer will benefit from

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.045
a strong foundational knowledge of the programming paradigms.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:25.575
Not that you need to go off and buy every textbook in order to write your next program,

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.355
but by understanding the principles and why's behind the paradigms,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.850
the way you think about your programs will become more refined and deep,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.140
and the solutions that you reach for to solve problems will become more intentional.
