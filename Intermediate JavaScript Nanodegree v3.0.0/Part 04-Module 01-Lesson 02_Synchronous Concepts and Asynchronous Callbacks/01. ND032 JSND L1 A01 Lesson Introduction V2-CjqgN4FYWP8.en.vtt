00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Welcome to this lesson on Synchronous Programming.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:06.000
The goal of this lesson is to lay a good foundation and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
set the basic concepts so that future lessons are easier.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.990
The topics we will cover are an introduction to threads.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.855
We won't be going into any great detail on threads.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.090
For instance, we won't cover hardware or anything,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.180
but we will take a little time to cover what you need to know

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.525
about threads in order to understand a synchronous code later on.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.075
We'll cover blocking versus non-blocking.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:30.840
You might have heard people talk about blocking or non-blocking actions in code.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.330
In this lesson, we'll go into detail about

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.310
this concept and practice writing non-blocking code.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.270
We'll also cover terms for asynchronous and multi-threaded programs.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.860
There are lots of new words you will hear when learning about

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.210
asynchronous and multi-threaded programming,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.265
and many of them get misused.

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:49.400
So we will take some time to define

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
those terms so that you're comfortable using them and,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.540
most importantly, because they come in handy for interviews.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.240
We'll wrap up with callbacks for asynchronous functionality.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.915
You've used callbacks already and are used to following function chains,

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.970
but in this lesson, we'll revisit them with

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.030
an eye for how they play into asynchronous functionality.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.955
After these concepts and some hands-on practice,

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:13.680
we'll be ready to move onto promises.
