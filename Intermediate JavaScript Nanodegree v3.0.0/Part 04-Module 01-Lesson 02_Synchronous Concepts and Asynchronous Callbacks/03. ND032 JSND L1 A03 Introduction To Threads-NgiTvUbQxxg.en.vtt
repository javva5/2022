00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Threads are where computers do work.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.850
One thread can do one thing at a time.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.125
When we write code,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.440
we are creating a to-do list for the thread we're using.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.600
Going one task at a time,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.605
the thread will follow our program until it reaches the end of the instructions.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.385
Ninety-nine percent of the time you write JavaScript programs,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.560
you will be writing single-threaded programs,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.395
because JavaScript is a single threaded language.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:28.095
A little bit more about threads.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.435
Ever since computers were first invented,

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:32.715
there's been a drive to make them faster.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.980
Recently, the most common way to make computing faster has been to add more threads.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.384
Computers have cores of threads that operate together to run programs.

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:45.245
Your computer has a certain number of cores.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.065
You might have taken this number into account when you purchased it.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.450
Typically there are two threads per core,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.180
so an eight-core machine has 16 threads,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.120
16 processes that can be running at once.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.355
But back to synchronous programming.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:01.580
We now understand what a single-threaded program is.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.835
Here is the most important thing to get out of this video.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.855
Synchronous and asynchronous programming,

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.200
both happen on a single thread.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.675
They are just two different ways of managing that thread.

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.730
If we know we are constrained to a single thread,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.670
that only one thing can happen at a time,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.400
then the game comes down to how well we manage

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.505
that single thread in order to complete tasks efficiently.

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:29.825
Synchronous programs are the most basic types of programs possible.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.665
They make no effort to manage the thread.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:37.219
Up to now, you might not have been thinking about your program in terms of efficiency.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.845
So you were writing synchronous programs,

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:43.370
except where modern syntax automatically helps you do better.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.870
This is where we get to the purpose of the entire course.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.630
We are going to learn to manage our one thread like a boss,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.020
because that is what asynchronous programming is all about.
