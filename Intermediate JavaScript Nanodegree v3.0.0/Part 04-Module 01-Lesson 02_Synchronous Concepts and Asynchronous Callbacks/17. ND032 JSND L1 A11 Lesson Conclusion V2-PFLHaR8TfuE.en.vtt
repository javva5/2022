00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
We've done a lot in this lesson.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:05.770
You now have a firm grounding in what synchronous programming is,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.510
and we got an overview of single-threaded,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.985
multi-threaded, blocking and non-blocking code.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:16.530
You learned how callbacks are the core strategy for letting our programs build on,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.470
and use the results from a synchronous operations,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.680
and that we can schedule them to run in callback chains.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.545
There have been a lot of new terms and concepts,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.020
but now all the dominoes are stacked and should

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.870
cascade right into the next lesson on promises.
