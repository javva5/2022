Hello and welcome to the Functional JavaScript course.

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.120
My name is Alyssa Hope and I'm going to be your instructor.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.725
As for a little bit about me,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.925
I'm a full-stack developer and primarily use JavaScript in my day-to-day work.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.325
I also have experience as an instructor.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.760
I was the lead instructor of a San Diego bootcamp and also taught

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.580
the build tool section of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.285
I don't have a background in computer science.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.280
Shout out to all the English majors out there.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.670
But it makes me especially excited to teach this course that dives

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.060
a little bit more into the academic side of programming and computer science.
