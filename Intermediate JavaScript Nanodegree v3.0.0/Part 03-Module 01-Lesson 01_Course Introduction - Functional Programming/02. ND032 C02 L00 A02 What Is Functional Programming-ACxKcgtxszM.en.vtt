At a meet up in a blog article.If you've been around the JavaScript community,

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.990
you've likely heard the term functional programming floating around, but what is it?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.405
Is it really a JavaScript thing?

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.945
In fact, functional programming is just a style of programming,

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:20.935
also known as the programming paradigm that can be used in almost any language.

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:25.520
What makes functional programming so attractive is that it focuses on being simple and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.070
efficient with a few rules to follow that can

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.250
make large programs more reliable and predictable.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.355
These rules are actually derived from mathematics,

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:38.044
in particular a branch of calculus called lambda calculus.

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:39.845
Though the rules are simple,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.900
they hold a wealth of good practices that will

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.930
benefit you even if you never code in a functional program.
