You're now equipped with the necessary skills and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.340
knowledge to create some functional programs of your own.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
We're going to focus on the many resources in libraries that might save you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.190
time or enable you to go further with

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.265
implementing functional programming in a professional setting.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.430
This course wouldn't be complete without introducing you to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.700
immutable RxJS, Ramda and Redux.
