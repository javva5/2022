Congratulations, and thank you for sticking with me through

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.210
this Functional JavaScript course. We've covered a lot.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.015
You got an overview of programming paradigms,

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.904
the history of Lambda calculus,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.945
a whirlwind tour of ES6,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.460
and saw an example of a functional web app,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.100
and we rounded out the lesson with

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
some awesome libraries to help you on your functional programming journey.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.150
In this project, you will be using all the skills to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.435
create a functional web dashboard for the NASA Mars Rovers.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:29.730
I really hope this course has been helpful for you,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.990
and good luck with the project.
