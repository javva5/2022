Hi, my name is Alyssa Hope and I'm going to be your instructor for this course.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:08.790
I'm a software engineer and spend most of my time writing React Apps.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.065
But for a long time,

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.075
I was scared of asynchronous code.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.900
I didn't know the whys behind the syntax I was using so I just

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.935
minimize the bare minimum and cross my fingers and hope that it would work.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.620
But that's not the right way to go about things,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.200
and asynchronous code is really a chance

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.975
for our programmatic thinking to be challenged and shine.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.755
So if you've ever been afraid of asynchronous programming,

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.090
you're in the right place.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.425
The goal of this course is to be a practical guide to the principles and syntax of

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:41.560
asynchronous programming to empower you to write even more sophisticated programs.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.100
Without further ado, let's get started.
