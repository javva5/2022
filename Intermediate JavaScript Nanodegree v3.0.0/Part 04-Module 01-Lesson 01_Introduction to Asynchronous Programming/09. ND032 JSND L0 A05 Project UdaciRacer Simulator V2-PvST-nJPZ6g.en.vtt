00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
In the UdaciRacer project,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.630
you will be able to race against

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.800
simulated characters and prove your mastery of asynchronous JavaScript.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.945
You will need to complete partially built out asynchronous flows that use callbacks,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.725
promises, and async/await syntax to control the events of the game.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.125
Now let's take a look at what you'll build.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.180
In the product for this course,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.985
you will be building a racing simulation game.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:27.870
The racing simulation game can be themed to whatever you want.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.925
So for my project example,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.770
I chose Star Wars.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.765
In this game, you will be able to choose racers and race tracks.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.610
Each racer will have a top speed acceleration in

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.400
handling that make them better or worse at handling a specific race track.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.135
If I select a race track and a racer,

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:50.840
and start the race,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.530
I play by clicking as fast as I can to make my player go up in the leader board.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.645
If I stop clicking,

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:03.570
you'll also see my player go down in the leader board.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.320
At the end of the race, you'll see a scoreboard to show you how you've done,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.495
and you can start a new race.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.180
So hopefully, all of that gets you excited

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.120
to learn the course material and build this project.
