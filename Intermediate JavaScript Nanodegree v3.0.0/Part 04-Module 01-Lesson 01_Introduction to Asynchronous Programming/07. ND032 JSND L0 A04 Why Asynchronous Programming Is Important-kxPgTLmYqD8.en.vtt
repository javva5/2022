00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Maybe you've gotten pretty far without knowing any fancy asynchronous programming.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.970
So why should you learn it now?

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.675
What benefits will you get from knowing about it?

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.345
First of all, if you code in JavaScript,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.435
you're probably already using asynchronous code.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:20.340
JavaScript is asynchronous by default for I/O and DOM manipulations.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.370
So it's imperative to be comfortable with these concepts as

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.620
a JavaScript developer and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.400
asynchronous programming is really a base skill for any developer.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.890
In a typical Dev job,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.020
you will see and use asynchronous patterns daily.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.720
So learning asynchronous programming is absolutely

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.345
essential to moving beyond entry-level or junior web development.

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:43.250
Reason three is that asynchronous programming and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.790
the concepts surrounding it are only going to become more important.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.610
Programs rely more and more on the efficiency of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.035
their code in order to run quickly and good news.

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:56.495
Reason for is that these concepts of asynchronous programming

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.990
are natively supported in most modern programming languages.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.780
So as you learn everything here in JavaScript,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.660
all you have to learn is the syntax,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.640
if you wanted to do the same thing in languages like rust and go.
