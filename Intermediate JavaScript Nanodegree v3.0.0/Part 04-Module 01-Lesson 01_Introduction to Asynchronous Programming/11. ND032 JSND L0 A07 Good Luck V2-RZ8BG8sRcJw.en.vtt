00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
There's a lot ahead for us to do and I hope you're as excited as I am to get started.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.300
Remember that you can always go back to a previous section and the code examples from

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.950
the videos will be available in

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.965
the work spaces so that you can interact with them yourself.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.980
Remember, you can go back and watch the videos or

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.895
do the code challenges as many times as you need to.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:24.495
It might take a couple trials for these asynchronous ideas to really sink in.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.205
I know that it did for me,

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:31.150
but with that, I hope that you really enjoy the course and good luck.
