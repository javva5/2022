00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
We're off to a good start.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:06.255
You have an idea of the structure of the course and what's to come in the next lessons,

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:10.170
and we got an introduction to the concepts of asynchronous programming that will come

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.295
in handy for all sorts of things like reading files and making API requests.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:17.730
The core concepts of asynchronous programming that we went over,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.045
showed us that it's all about knowing where work is happening

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:25.050
and when a particular task might be waiting on an I/O operation.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.470
We talked about the importance of learning these skills and concepts,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.970
because asynchronous programming is a necessary skill for most web development tasks.
