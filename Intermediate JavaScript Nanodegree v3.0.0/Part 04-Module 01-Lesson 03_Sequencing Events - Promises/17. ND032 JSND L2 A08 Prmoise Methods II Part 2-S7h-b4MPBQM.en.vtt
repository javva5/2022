00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Now let's take a look at a very similar method, promised at all.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.405
There are so many similarities between promise all and promise allSettled,

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.655
that most people get them confused.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.840
Many people use promise all without really understanding, allSettled.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.310
But after this example,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.340
I think you'll see why people find these methods confusing,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.750
and why you're likely to use allSettled more than all.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
This code example is exactly the same as the last one,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.050
except that now we're calling promise all instead of allSettled.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.450
What will change when we run this? Let's try it.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.110
At first glance, it doesn't look like a whole lot really changed.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.390
We're still getting an array with

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.635
the names of each book that is the result of each promise.

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.420
But where promise allSettled,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.690
had also given the information of whether that promise resolved or rejected,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.560
promised at all only supplies the array.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.500
Though the output of all,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.480
and the output of allSettled right now,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.730
seems to be about the same and you might think that you could use them interchangeably.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.830
Let's take a look at another example to show

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.410
the big difference between all and allSettled.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.540
So let's take a look at this code.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.385
Just like in the last example,

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:14.290
I've changed book2, to reject instead of resolving.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.144
How do you think promise all will respond when one of the promises rejects?

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:21.410
Let's run the code and find out.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.015
Wow, now that is not what we expected.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:29.025
The main difference between promise allSettled and promise all,

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.690
is that promise all will stop watching the promises and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.255
fire the catch clause the first time it encounters a promise that rejects.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.010
That's always confused me and I think that promise all

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.725
should really have been named promise all resolved,

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:48.205
because it only returns a list of values if every single promise is successful.

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.735
Promise allSettled on the other hand,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:56.340
can handle resolved or rejected promises without triggering it's catch clause.
