00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
That was a long lesson,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.455
but we've accomplished so much and I hope you feel just how far you've come.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.585
We covered a lot of new information.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.595
So let's take a look at where we've been.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.390
We started off the lesson with the most basic Promise syntax.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.215
We covered Promise states and how to resolve and reject Promises.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.500
Then we learned that you can chain then statements to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
keep long asynchronous flow as clean and neat,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
and you put all of that knowledge together and the challenges to create promise chains.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.705
Next, we saw how Fetch uses Promises to handle HTTP requests.

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:37.460
We practiced our HTTP methods and Promise

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.255
handling at the same time as we wrote our own Fetch requests.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.509
We improved our error handling with catch statements

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.020
and learn some best practices related to Promise chains.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.520
Then finally, we took our knowledge of Promises even further by learning about

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.845
some methods to manage chains of Promises and deal with multiple Promises at once.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.305
I know this lesson might have been challenging,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:01.925
but I hope that here at the end of it,

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:05.120
you feel genuinely comfortable with the syntax and concepts of

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.110
Promises and ready to start using them fearlessly in your own programs.
