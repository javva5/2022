00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Did you find all the errors and get the last then-statement to run?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.110
I'll go over the issues in this code block and also

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.455
add in some bonus issues you might have caught along the way.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.825
The first issue is typos,

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.940
easy to miss and easy to do.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.745
But source here is spelled wrong.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:21.600
This error might have caused you, as it did me,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.120
to notice another issue that shows us some interesting things about how JavaScript works.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400
Did you notice that in some cases,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
the typo didn't cause an error in the program at all?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
In JavaScript, we often check for the existence of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.825
an object attribute before checking its contents.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:44.510
Here we see just how important that check is because if I remove it,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.595
but keep the typo in,

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.385
this code will still run,

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:54.550
and we actually hit this error instead of creating an error here.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.085
The second issue was in the second then-statement.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.710
We were so busy setting the category,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.705
we forgot to return the data,

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:07.480
which causes an error in the following then-chain when no data is passed in.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.925
Here I've fixed it by returning data.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.670
But if we wanted to be a little bit more efficient,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.595
we could destructure out the message and pass

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:20.420
only the values to the next then-chain that it actually needs,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.700
which are id and message.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.865
That's the end of the challenges section.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.560
I hope it helped you feel a little bit more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.470
confident about the concepts we've learned in this section.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.040
The next section will be about Fetch and Ajax requests.
